# Transcription Analysis

This file contains a working description of the steps working with the transcriptions.  There are several obvious errors in the transcriptions, so this will attempt to document them until we have a working product with a high probability of performing a transcription.  Generally, we will assume that the mathematics terms will be in most of the embeddings, but it is likely that the matematics equations give us some problems.  These will probably be the biggest headache.

I am downloading the smallest GloVe file and trying out that against the vocabulary in some of the transcriptions.
