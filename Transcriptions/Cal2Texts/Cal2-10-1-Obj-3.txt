
Okay now lets use the Taylor polynomials to approximate some of the values. I want to find Taylor polynomials of order 0, 1, 2, and 3 for the function f(x) = e^x centered at x=0.
Okay so the polynomial, I am going to go ahead and write down what the 3rd one looks like and we will just take less turns for the others. So P3(x) is going to be f(a) which our a here is 0, f(0), plus f prime of 0 times x plus f double prime of 0 over 2! X^2 plus f triple prime of 0 x^3 over 3!
Okay so then P2 would just be the first 3 and P1 would be the first 2 terms. Okay so lets come over to the side and I am going to actually calculate what my derivatives are. I have f(x) is e^x. that means f prime of x, if I am finding the 3rd order polynomial I need the 3rd derivative.
So that will be e^x. f double prime of x will be e^x. f triple prime of x will be e^x. Now plug in x=0 into each of those. So f(0) will be e^0 which is 1. F prime of 0 will be 1. F double prime of 0 will be 1. And f triple of 0 will be 1. So that makes it easy.
So all of these come out to be just 1. Okay just the derivatives evaluated at 0. Okay, so we just want the first, okay p0. So p0(x) would just be taking this first term. So that would just be this part of it. So it is just going to be f(0) which for this particular function is just 1. P1(x) is the first two terms. So that is f(0) + f prime of 0 x which will be 1 + x.
P2(x) will be f(0) + f prime of 0 x + f double prime of 0 x^2 over 2 which will be 1 + x + 1/2 x^2 and now finally p3(x), I am just going to go ahead and write the previous polynomial down, and then it is + that one extra term. And so I am going to have 1 + x + x^2/ 2 + x^3 / 3! and that is our 3rd order Taylor polynomial. And it also matches the degree in this case.
Okay, so now I want to use the polynomials to approximate e^.1 and then find the errors involved. Okay, e^.1, if I am going to approximate it with p0, p0(.1) I am using the x to be the value that is in the exponent. It is e^x okay that is the exponent so that is the value that I use in the polynomial.
So that is just going to be p0 will just be 1. So let me write it up here. P0(.1) is going to be 1. There is no x there to plug into. P1(.1) is going to be 1 + .1. P2(.1) will be 1 + .1 + 1/2 .1^2 okay which comes out to be 1.105.
Okay and then the last one then, okay so in red I am approximating e^.1 using the polynomials. So then finally p3(.1) is going to b 1 + .1  + .1^2 /2 + .1^3 /3! which is equal to 1.105167. Okay, and you can do the same thing with the -.25. Just plug in -.25 for the x in each one of these polynomials.

Okay now I got these values, a table that we will look at. These are the values that we got for e^.1 using each of the polynomials, p0, p1, p2, p3. The absolute error, if you use your calculator to calculate e^.1 and use the accuracy that is has and subtract what answers we actually got for these, the errors involved were 1.05 * 2^(-1). So that is .105 then .00517, .000171. You can see the higher order derivative that we used, the better accuracy. Now that is .00000425 accuracy just using the 3rd order polynomial to approximate e^.1
Now, calculating e^(-.25) do the same thing plugging the values. These are the values you get from the polynomials. If you use your calculator to figure out the error involved you get these values. Notice you got .000155 here for the 3rd order polynomial for using x = -.25. The accuracy is not as great as it was from .1, but you do not expect it to be because you are further away from x=0, you know, .1 was closer to our a than what -.25 is. The further away you get from that point that you center it at, the less accuracy you are going to have.
But still, that is pretty good accuracy for just using a polynomial to approximate an exponential. A polynomial you can calculate yourself may take you some time to multiply a value times itself three or four times but you can evaluate polynomials with just multiplications and sums and differences whereas otherwise the exponential you need a table or a calculator or something to evaluate. 
So you get better accuracy, you get faster accuracy by hand and you are able to actually get a value.


Okay, now another thing I want to do here is actually lets approximate the square root of 18. Now that is a value, you know square roots, we are trying to approximate what the square toot of 18 is. 
You know it is somewhere near the square of 16 because you can evaluate square root of 16 in your head, but otherwise you are kind of at a loss for getting square roots unless you can get a value near that 18.
So lets look at polynomials of order 0,1,2,3. So the 3rd order polynomial here will be f(0), we are not going to use 0 though. We do not want to center this one at 0. We are trying to get the square root of 18.  So if you look at your square root function which is this function right here, actually it is the black one, if you are trying to approximate that function at x=18, then provably you need to get something near 18 that you can calculate the exact value for. 
So lets choose 16 since that is, you know, square root of 16 is 4, the square root of 25 is 5, so square root of 16 is closer to the square root of 18. So we are going to center it at 16 and that is when we are going to get the polynomials to approximate, you know, at that point. So it is good to have accuracy around 16.
So my a here is going to be 16. So the 3rd order polynomial is going to be f(16) + f prime of 16 times x + f double prime of 16 over 2 , x^2 and then + the 3rd order derivative at 16, x^3 and then all over 3! So that is the 3rd order derivative. We know take one less term for the others.
Okay so now lets go over to the side and lets calculate. The function we are going to use, we are already given f(x) here but since we are approximating the square root of a number lets use the square root function.
So that is x^(1/2). So f prime of x will be 1/2 x^(-1/2) which is 1/(2 * square root of x). f double prime of x is going to be -1/4 x^(-3/2), I am using this formula right here to get the derivate using the power rule, which and then if I simplify that would be -1/(4 times the square root of x^3).
And you can do the cube on the outside of the square root too. Let me go ahead and do that. It is easier to evaluate if you do that.so it is 4 times (the square root of x) cubed. And now the 3rd order derivative is going to be 3/8 x^(-5/2) which is going to be 3/((8 square root of x)^5).
Okay so now lets evaluate each of these at 16. We are centering it at 16. So we are going to have f(16) which is the square root of x, which is 4. F prime of 16 is 1/(2 square root of 16) which is going to be 1/8. F double prime of 16 is -1/(4 (square root of 16)^3). So that is -1/(4 *4^3) so that will be 64. That is -1/256. And then finally f triple prime of 16 is 3/8 times square root of 16 which is 4 to the 5th power. 
And that comes out to be 3/8192. Okay so now lets find our polynomials. I am just going to write it out and take pieces of it. F(16) is 4. F prime of 16 is 1/8. F double prime of 16 is -1/256. There is the 1/2 that is built into the formula. -1/256 x^2. Then I have 1/6 in the formula and then f triple prime of 16 is 3/8192.
Okay, so now if I want the first, p1 or p0(x) it is just going to be 4. P1(x) will be 4 + 1/8 x. p2(x) will be 4 + 1/8 x - 1/512 x^2. And then p3(x). 3 cancels and you get 16384 on the bottom. And that is your 3rd order polynomial.
Okay so now if you want to approximate square root of 18, I would find p0(18). I am putting in x=18 and I have polynomials built centered at 16. So I am going to have 4 because there is nowhere to plug in the x in that on. P1(18) is going to be 4 + 1/8(18), lets see divide, that will be 9/4 so 2.25 so that is 6.25.
Okay and here is where I am seeing a couple of mistakes because I know that is not right. When I center this polynomial I carried away and kept them as x up here, but we are centering them at 16. So this should have been x-16. (x-16)^2. (x-16)^3.
Okay so each one of these should have been x-16, (x-16)^2, (x-16)^3. Sometimes you do 0 too many times. Okay so each one if these, I kept the form, it should have been x-16, this one should have been and then -1/512(x-16)^2. So all I am doing is I need to put that x-16 in place of all the x. it actually makes it a lot easier to evaluate too. And then I had plus 1/16384(x-16)^3. Okay now we are set.
So now when we plug in 18 here, we should have had 18-16. So it should have been 4+ 2/8 which is 1/4. So that is just 4.25. And now p2(18) lets see now we are just going to be able to take the difference each time. So we are going to have 4 plus the .25 which is the 2/8. And then we are going to have minus 1/512 times 2 and that comes out to be 4.242188. 
Okay and the same thing here when you do p3(18) you will just out 18 here, here, and here, and once you do all that division you are going to get 4.242676. Okay you still, this polynomial you will have to do some division which makes it more complicated, but that will be your values. Polynomial at 18 is 4, 4.25, 4.24, and then 4.2426 so you see that the value is getting closer and closer to whatever the square root of 18 is.
And so here is a list of those values and the absolute error. So if you use your calculator to actually get the, you know, as accurate as you calculator can show you for the square root of 18 and find that absolute error, just subtracting what we got from these polynomials. These are the absolute error and so you can see that we are down here just using that 3rd order polynomial at 18 we now have .000351. 
So we got that much accuracy just using that 3rd order polynomial to approximate the square root function
