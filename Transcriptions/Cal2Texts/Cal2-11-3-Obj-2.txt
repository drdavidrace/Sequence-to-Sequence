We want to find the area of a region bound by polar curves. You got a function r equal f of theta with graph in polar coordinates.
It is bound by theta = alpha and theta = beta. To approximate the area of this region R we are going to divide it into n sectors.
So we are going to partition this angle from theta = alpha to theta = beta into n sectors. Now I will have theta1 will be the angle that first, like our sub intervals like when we did Riemann sums, we have theta2 theta3. So that I want what the area of this kth sector is.
Okay, now you determine that area by choosing some angle inside that sector. So just for some random angle here, and I am going to determine what the r value is and that is going to be the r value for the entire sector
So now lets review what you did back in trig to find the area of a sector. So we have a circle. A sector will have the center here will be the center of the circle and we are going to draw radii out to the edge of the circle.
So if I want to find the area of this sector, I can see that it is just going to be a fraction of the area of the whole circle.
Now the area of the whole circle I am going to assume the area is r. The area of the whole circle will be pi times r squared. Well the fraction of the whole circle that I want is determined by this central angle
And the fraction will be the angle for the portion I am trying to get the area f divided by the angle of the entire circle which will be 2pi
So the area of this sector will be equal to 1/2 r squared times theta. So for the sector that we are trying to determine the area for this rth sector, I am going to have 1/2 the r which is going to be the f of some theta in that subinterval sub k squared and then times the delta theta sub k
So that is just going to be the size of this angle right here. Okay so that is the area of one sector, the kth sector. So if I want the area of the entire region I am going to sum the n sectors areas so that is from k=1 to n, and then I am going to get the limit as n goes to infinite
That is going to allow the number of sectors to increase which will then more closely approximate the area of that region. Now recall that this limit of this sum of n terms is the same thing as definite integral of 1/2 the f of theta is our function squared times d theta, and that theta is the variable here and the values range from theta=alpha to theta=beta
So this will be the area of the region R. 



Okay so here is your formula. Now the one I just developed showed the region going all the way up to where the origin is. Lets say that instead of the region, the shaded region, going all the way up to the origin we are going to stop it at another function so that now we actually have the region bounded between two functions
This one r=g(theta) and then this outer bound is r=f(theta). Now to determine upper and lower bounds, you know when you were looking at vertical rectangles, you looked for upper bounds and lower bounds for the ys.
When you looked at horizontal rectangles you looked at left bonds and right bounds for the xs. When you are looking for bounds for the r, what you want to look at is a ray going from the origin out through the region.
Now that ray could be anywhere from the beginning of the angle theta=alpha to theta=beta. But when you draw that ray you want to know what is the r value when you enter the shaded region. Well you enter the shaded region for this r value here.
So the lower bound for the rs will be g(theta). The outer bound for the rs will be the f(theta). Okay, so if you want to calculate the area between g(theta) and f(theta) what we can do is can calculate the entire area from the pole here at the origin out to r=f(theta).
So this would be the entire area. It is 1/2 f(theta) squared d theta, and that is from alpha to beta. And then I am going to subtract off the area that is between the g and the pole. So it is going to be minus the integral from alpha to beta, 1/2 g(theta) squared
Okay, and that is going to give me this region R. putting that together we have the integral from alpha to beta of 1/2, I am just factoring the 1/2 out of both terms, f(theta) squared minus the g(theta) squared
So look for the outer bound for the rs and the inner bound for the rs. Okay so this is equivalent to when you were looking for the area between two functions. You had y=f(theta) and you lower bound is y=g(theta) and we were finding the are from a to b
So if you were looking for this area you took the integral of the upper bound which was f(theta)  minus the lower bound which was g(theta) from a to b. So we are doing to same thing here but because we are in polar coordinates, to get the areas we will have to do the 1/2 f(theta) squared for the integrand each time
So this is the formula for getting the area between two polar graphs, r=f(theta) and r=g(theta) between the bounds theta=alpha and theta=beta. 

Okay so now I how do we apply this? I want the area of this four-leafed rose. What I want to do is I need to find the angles that are spanned through that generate this graph. So locate a point and you can do that by just plotting, you know, plugging in values of theta. If I plug in theta=0 in this graph I have that the r is equal 2cos0 which is just going to be the number 2.
So I am at this point (2,0). So I know where the r is at that point. Now as you rotate around that curve and generate that curve by rotating through values of theta you are drawing the graph. When we get to theta equal, it is actually pi over 4 even though it is not obvious from the graph. Theta =pi/4 we are actually at this point on the pole
So this would be the point 0 for the r, pi/4 for the theta. We have just spanned through just the top half of that one rose. So if I am wanting to find this area I would find the integral, now when I am determining my angles I have to know what angle I started with here and what angle I ended here. And so this limits would be 0 to pi/4. 
Okay, now my r values. Imagine a ray going from the origin out through that region. So here would be the place when the theta is started at 0 and then I am going to have, go out at another point in between theta=0 and theta=pi/4
Now, the ray is inside that shaded region when it is actually at the pole. So our lowest bound for our theta is actually going to be 0. So r=0. So in other words, we do not need to take a difference of two functions. We have the inner function is at the pole which would be r=0
So using the equation we are going to use 1/2 f(theta) squared minus just 0 for the g(theta) since it goes all the way to the pole. So the formula will be 1/2 f(theta) which is 2cos2theta, the whole functions squared, and then d theta because when I am leaving the shaded region I am passing through the equation, the graph r=2cos2theta
So if you drew any rays in here, the ray is in the shaded region as soon as it exits through the origin and it passes out of the shaded region when it goes across this equation r=2cos2theta. So that will be that upper, that outer bound for the r
Okay so now lets evaluate. I have got the 1/2 I am going to pull out in front. I have got a 2 inside the parenthesis that will be squared. So I am going to go ahead and put 2^2 out here in front of the integral. 
I am going to have a cos^2 of 2theta and the bounds are 0 to pi/4. Now lets wait a minute. The region that I just spanned from 0 to pi/4 is only 1/8 of the whole rose.
I am asked for the area of the whole four leaf rose. So what I am finding is I am just going to be finding an eighth of it. So if I want the area of the entire rose I am going to use the fact that it is symmetric and multiply this by 8
Okay so now back to finishing our problem. I got 8 times 4 will be 32 times a half, so that is going to be 16. The integral of cos^2 2theta requires the power reducing formula. So I am going to put 1/2 in front and I will have 1 + cos4theta, still 0 to pi/4. Okay integrating I am going to have 8 times the integral of 1 is just going to be theta, the integral of cos4theta will be 1/4 sin4theta and that is from 0 to pi/4
Evaluate it at pi/4 and then I will evaluate at 0. Sin of pi is 0. Sin of 0 is 0. And the area of the entire four leafed rose is 2pi. 



Okay now lets find the area of the region inside the circle r=1 and inside the cardioid given by r=1+costheta. So I am looking for the area here. 
Now that region that is inside the circle and inside the cardioid does have symmetry. The portion that is above the x-axis is the same as the portion below the x-axis
So what I want to find is just half of the region and then I will divide it by 2. And to do so, I want to look at some rays. Will there be the same bounds for this entire region? If you drew some rays, this is where my ray starts, that is where the area began if I am just getting that portion that is above the x-axis, the polar axis. 
If I started drawing rays rotating it around, the ray is inside the shaded region from the pole from the origin. So the place it is exiting that shaded region is actually this curve. Okay so this is the curve that is actually where the region is ending
Now continue looking at rays rotated around and they are still always exiting that shaded region through that graph of the circle which is r=1. Now what if we rotated it further? We are here and now rotating around over in this region is the same bound, the graph that you are leaving the area is what it was on the other side.
As you draw rays from the origin out here for this region of this graph this portion of the graph, the boundary for the R is actually a cardioid. Here is our cardioid. So we are going to use a different r value, a different function, for this region. 
Okay so that has the bound, it is the cardioid, whereas this portion of the area has the bound that is the circle. So we will have to do those two regions as two separate integrals. Okay so lets find the first one.
The integral, now the angles from here to here would be theta = 0 to theta = pi/2. Now you got to be careful because that may not be pi/2 and may not be 0 that actually creates these points. It is always good to actually plug those in to the equation and see if you are actually at that point.
If theta = 0 and I plug it in to this first equation the r will be 1 so this is the point (1,0). If I plug in theta = pi/2 into the circle or the cardioid in to the circle it is r = 1 so this will be the point (1,pi/2). And put pi/2 into the cardioid and I have 1 + cos(pi/2) which cos(pi/2) is 0 which is also 1
So my angels spans from 0 to pi/2 for this red shaded region. Now the integrand will be the 1/2 the r which is the circle r=1. So 1/2 r^2 times d theta. So that will be 1/2 theta evaluated from 0 to pi/2 which would be just pi/4
And we really could have gotten that without using an integral. That is just half of, a fourth of the area of a circle and the circle has radius 1 so if you used pi r^2, 1 ^2 and taken a fourth of it that would be that shaded region
Okay now for this green region here, I am going to have the integral. I got to determine the angle. I know the angle here is pi/2. I need to know the angle where I am actually finishing this portion of the graph. So to determine this angle can see that the r is equal to 0 for the cardioid so if I go up to the cardioid and put in r=0 I would have the costheta is -1. That occurs when theta = pi. So this point would be r=0 theta = pi. 
So my limits of integration for the green region will be from pi/2 to pi and my integrand would be 1/2. Now the function that is actually outer bound for this graph, remember we are looking at rays passing through that region, you are exiting the region when you pass through the curve which is the cardioid. So it will be the 1 + costheta squared d theta
So now lets go ahead and calculate that out. We are going to need to square the 1 + costheta. So that will be, I will put the 1/2 in front, 1 + 2costheta + cos squared theta d theta. Use the power reducing formula.
1/2 (1 + cos2theta) is equivalent to cos squared. Simplifying, I have a 1 + 1/2 so that is 3/2. I have 2costheta and half cos2theta. Integrating, 3/2 theta, 2sintheta + 1/4 sin2theta. Evaluate at pi we have 1/2 3/2 times pi. Sin of pi is 0. Sin of 2pi will be 0. And then minus, evaluated at pi/2. 
Sin pi/2 will be 1 and sin pi will be 0. We will have 3pi/8 minus 1 when you distribute the minus sign through. So that is 3pi/8 - 1. Putting it all together, that is this one green region here. So the entire area is equal to twice what we found above for the red part plus what we found for the green part.
So that is 2 (5pi/8 - 1). Notice part of this region you actually enter the shaded region after passing over the cardioid. That is the beginning of the shaded region, and you leave the shaded region when you pass over the circle. So the inner bound will be this cardioid for the r and the outer bound will be the circle r=1. 
So when we set up the graph we will have the integral from pi/2 to pi, 1/2 the outer bound which is the 1^2, that is the r^2 f(theta)^2, minus the inner bound which is (1 + costheta)^2 d theta. Square this out. I am going to pull out the 1/2 in front. 1^2 minus 1 plus 2costheta plus cos squared. I am going to replace cos squared with 1/2 (1 + cos2theta) 
1/2 the anti-derivative of 2costheta will be -2sintheta minus 1/4 times 1/2 sin2theta evaluating from pi/2 to pi. I am going to distribute this 1/2 through. I will have -sintheta minus 1/16 sin2theta. Okay just noticed that I took a negative up here for a multiplication. So lets backtrack. 
Integrate minus 1/2 theta minus 1/4 sin2theta. Okay evaluating. I am going to distribute the 1/2 through. I have -sintheta minus 1/4 theta minus 1/8 sin2theta. Evaluating, minus sinpi is 0. I will have -pi/4 sin2pi is 0. And then minus sinpi/2 will be a -1 minus 1/4 pi/2 and then sinpi would be 0.
And this gives me 1 - pi/8. Now remember we just calculated the top half of that region. So the entire region, which includes this bottom half now, will be twice that. And that is the area inside the circle, outside the cardioid.
